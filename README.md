## Findings
- Total inventory is 1905 items with a total order volume of 1M and an inventory value of 706.21K.
- Sales dropped sharply in 2023, showing a -73.93% YoY growth.
- The West region leads in sales, followed by South and East.
- Arts & Entertainment is the highest-selling product category; Mobiles and Computers have the lowest share.
- California tops in state-wise sales; Florida and Texas are next.
- March had the highest monthly sales, while December had the lowest.
- Debit is the most used payment method, followed by others like cash and credit.
- Stores like Argyle Store and Clarges Store are top performers.
- Sales remained fairly stable from 2019 to 2022, but profit margins didn't grow significantly.
## Recommendations
To improve overall performance, it's important to investigate the sharp drop in sales during 2023 and identify what went wrongâ€”whether it's due to internal issues, market changes, or customer behavior. Boosting the sales of low-performing products like mobiles and computers through promotions or better pricing can help balance category performance. Since the West region and stores like Argyle Store are doing well, their strategies can be applied in weaker areas. Also, optimizing inventory based on regional demand can reduce waste and improve efficiency. As most customers prefer debit payments, enhancing that experience while encouraging other payment methods may lead to higher conversions. Lastly, profits have remained flat despite steady sales, so revisiting costs and offering premium products could help improve margins.
