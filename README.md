7. **Sales vs Profit Trends**  
   - Profit plateaued at **40M** in 2021 and 2022 despite sales growth.
   - In **2023**, both sales and profit dropped significantly, suggesting inefficiencies or market shrinkage.

### Recommendations

To improve overall performance, it's important to investigate the sharp drop in sales during 2023 and identify what went wrongâ€”whether it's due to internal issues, market changes, or customer behavior. Boosting the sales of low-performing products like mobiles and computers through promotions or better pricing can help balance category performance. Since the West region and stores like Argyle Store are doing well, their strategies can be applied in weaker areas. Also, optimizing inventory based on regional demand can reduce waste and improve efficiency. As most customers prefer debit payments, enhancing that experience while encouraging other payment methods may lead to higher conversions. Lastly, profits have remained flat despite steady sales, so revisiting costs and offering premium products could help improve margins.
